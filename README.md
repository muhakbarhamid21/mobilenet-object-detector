# Object Detection App

A Flutter-based object detection mobile application that uses machine learning models to identify objects in real-time through the camera.

## Features

- Machine Learning powered Android Application
- Real-time object detection using the device camera
- Detect objects in any of the following ways:
  - From an image chosen from the Gallery
  - From an image captured within the App
  - Real-time detection in video stream
- Pre-trained model integration (e.g. TensorFlow Lite)
- Displays detected objects with bounding boxes and labels
- Lightweight and fast inference
- Cross-platform support (Android & iOS)

## Model Used

This app supports TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) object detection models. You can replace or update the `.tflite` file in the `assets/models` directory and update the labels accordingly.
